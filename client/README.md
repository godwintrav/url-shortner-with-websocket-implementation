### CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION

This Client implementation was created to test out that the application works correctly. The way it works is you run the        `client-example.js` in a seperate terminal by using the command `node client-example.js`.

This command should only be run if the application is running on `localhost:3000`. After running the client example you will see the full application flow be simulated fully.
