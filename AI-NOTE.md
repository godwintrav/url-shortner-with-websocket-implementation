## ChatGpt's Role

In this task I used chatgpt to debate the best architecture and protocol for the Task.

I evaluated the best decision based on the task requirement. 

I also used it to generate boilerplate code to work faster.'

I came to a conclusion to use websocket for the protocol to respond to the client and the reason for this is it's the only protocol I can send an acknowledgement using the same protocol as the response sent.
